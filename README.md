### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yovana Pelayo and I am located in Portland, Oregon. I am a Fullstack Software Developer that is currently working on BrainJuice ðŸ§ .

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mental health, blogging, and social media applications. Looking for experience to build my professional portfolio and assist in managing or building something I am proud of.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love kayaking and I am a DIY queen. Catch me on Youtube looking up how to tutorials, and following them successfully, or looking up how to make bread from scratch.
