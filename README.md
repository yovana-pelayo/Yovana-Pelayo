### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yovana Pelayo and I am located in Portland, Oregon. I am a Fullstack Software Developer that is currently working on a Guest Book React App.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mental health applications, blogging or social media applications and anything that will add to my professional experience as a Software Developer.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love kayaking and I am a DIY queen. Catch me on Youtube looking up how to replace a Macbook keyboard with a backlight (successfully âœ…) or looking up how to make make bread from scratch.
